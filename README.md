# Recur

*Recur* is an Elixir library providing recurring events support. After forking from [recurring_events by pbogut] (https://github.com/pbogut/recurring_events), I began to see a simple approach, so I started from scratch on the implementation,
but I borrowed as many test cases as possible.

## Documentation

API documentation is not available quite yet at [https://hexdocs.pm/recur](https://hexdocs.pm/recur)

## Installation

The package can not yet be installed as:

  Add `recur` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:recur, "~> 0.0.1"}]
    end
    ```
