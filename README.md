# Recur

*Recur* is an Elixir library providing recurring events support
(duh!). I forked it from pbogut to experiment a bit. If I come up with anything good, I'll probably submit a PR, so I would
start with the [original](https://github.com/pbogut/recurring_events).

## Documentation

API documentation is available at [https://hexdocs.pm/recurring_events](https://hexdocs.pm/recurring_events)

## Installation

The package can be installed as:

  Add `recurring_events` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

    ```elixir
    def deps do
      [{:recurring_events, "~> 0.1.0"}]
    end
    ```
